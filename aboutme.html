      <p>I am Juni and I am a student in GIS!</p>
      <p>I'm currently in middle school and I was born and live in the capital city of Maldives, Male'. Maldives is a very peaceful place to live compared to other countries, especially on the beach sides. I love Maldives also because it is cleaner and less poluted than other countries. But slowly, my home is facing the problems other countries have already faced. I made this website for awareness of problems faced by the Earth. If you look around a bit, you will see that there is a page on Global warming that I've posted on this website. I tried hard on the page so you might aswell just check it out!
